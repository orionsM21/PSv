# 🚀 PSv - Scalable Fintech React Native Architecture

A production-grade React Native application demonstrating a **modular, scalable architecture** for fintech systems like Loan Origination (LOS), Collections, Payments, and more.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

Fintech applications typically involve:

- Multiple independent modules (LOS, Collections, Payments)
- Role-based access (Admin, Loan Officer, Agent)
- Dynamic environments (different BASE URLs)
- Secure API communication
- Complex state management

This project solves these challenges using a **clean, scalable architecture**.

---

## 🏗 Architecture Overview
UI (Screens / Components) ↓ Redux (State Management) ↓ Service Layer (Business Logic) ↓ API Client (Axios + Interceptors) ↓ Backend

### Key Principles:
- Separation of concerns
- Feature-based modular architecture
- Centralized API handling
- Reusable components

## ✨ Features

- ✅ Role-based module access
- ✅ Modular architecture (plug-and-play features)
- ✅ Dynamic BASE_URL (runtime config)
- ✅ Centralized API handling using Axios interceptors
- ✅ File upload support (Blob handling)
- ✅ Persistent authentication (AsyncStorage)
- ✅ Automatic logout on token expiry (401 handling)

---

## ⚡ Performance Optimizations

- `useMemo` → Avoid unnecessary recalculations
- `React.memo` → Prevent unnecessary re-renders
- `useCallback` → Stable function references
- Optimized `FlatList` rendering

---

## 🔐 Security

- Secure token storage using AsyncStorage
- Automatic session expiration handling
- Protected API calls using interceptors

---

## 📈 Impact

- Built scalable modular architecture for fintech flows
- Reduced code duplication via shared API/service layer
- Improved maintainability with clear separation of concerns
- Enabled easy addition of new modules without affecting existing ones
